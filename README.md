# Object of the Game
Correctly repeat a longer and longer sequence of signals.

1. Press any key to Start. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by clicking on the same color button. You will move up a level.

2. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color buttons, in order.

3. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

4. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.

5. If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends. You can press any key to restart
